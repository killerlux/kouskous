---

## 🌐 Localization Requirements

### Languages (Priority Order)
1. **Arabic** (Primary) — RTL layout
2. **French** (Secondary) — LTR layout
3. **English** (Optional) — LTR layout

### RTL Considerations
- Flip entire layout for Arabic
- Mirror icons where appropriate
- Keep numbers LTR (e.g., prices: 50 TND)
- Keep maps LTR (universal convention)
- Phone numbers LTR with Arabic digits option

### Cultural Adaptations
- Use local currency (TND not $)
- 24-hour time format (common in Tunisia)
- Friday-Saturday weekend awareness
- Prayer time considerations (optional)
- Ramadan mode (optional, reduced notifications)

---

## 📐 Screen Sizes & Breakpoints

### Mobile Apps (Flutter)
- **Target**: iOS 12+ and Android 8+
- **Primary**: 375x667 (iPhone SE) to 428x926 (iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- **Android**: 360x640 to 412x915
- **Tablets**: 768x1024 (iPad) — low priority

### Admin Web (Next.js)

## 🎬 Animations & Micro-interactions

### Principles
- **Purposeful**: Animations should aid understanding
- **Fast**: 200-300ms for most transitions
- **Smooth**: Easing curves (ease-in-out)
- **Subtle**: Not distracting

### Key Animations
1. **Ride Request**: Pulse on map, expanding circle
2. **Driver Accepted**: Success checkmark animation
3. **Loading**: Skeleton screens (not spinners everywhere)
4. **Transitions**: Fade + slide for screen changes
5. **Success**: Confetti or checkmark for deposit approval
6. **Lock Warning**: Gentle shake for 1000 TND warning

---

## 🚦 Key User Flows to Design

4. **History** → View past rides

### **Driver App**
1. **Onboarding** → Phone verification → Document upload → Wait approval
2. **Go Online** → Toggle online → Wait for rides
3. **Accept Ride** → New request → Accept → Navigate → Pickup → Start → Complete → Cash payment
4. **Earnings Lock** → See warning at 900 TND → Locked at 1000 TND → Submit deposit → Wait approval → Unlocked
5. **Earnings** → View balance → View history

### **Admin Web**
1. **Login** → Phone verification → Dashboard
2. **Approve Driver** → Queue → View documents → Approve/Reject → Next
3. **Approve Deposit** → Queue (FIFO) → View receipt → Check amount → Approve/Reject → Driver unlocked
4. **Monitor** → Dashboard → View metrics → Investigate issues
